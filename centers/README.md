### Mean, Median and Mode

**Mean:**
- The average. = SUM(X) / length.
- Not effected by change in bin size.
- Will change as any data point changes.

**Median:**
- Middle value.
- Must sort data first.
- Not effected by change in bin size.
- Not effected by severe outliers.

**Mode:**
- The label / value with highest frequency.
- Not effected by outliers.
- Easy to find on a histogram plot.

**Quartiles:**
- In stats, you divide your data into [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile).
- Q1 = median([X1...Xn])
- Q2 = median([X1...Xn/2])
- Q3 = median([Xn/2...Xn])
- IQR = Q3 - Q1

**outliers:**
- A data point, d, is a statistical outlier **if (d < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) or (d > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))**
